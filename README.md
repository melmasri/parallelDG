# Bayesian inference for decomposable graphical models using Parallel Metropolis-Hastings MC
A library that implements parallel sampling of decomposable (chordal) graphical models.
Currently supported functionalities include:

- Bayesian structure learning for discrete log-linear and Gaussian data.

### Installation
This package currently requires Python 2.7.
If graphviz is not installed, you can install it from brew / aptitude / pacman for example
```
$ brew install graphviz
```
On Linux system (i.e. Ubuntu/Debian) you might need to run
```
$ apt install python-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
```

Then run
```
$ pip install parallelDG
```

It is also possible to pull parallelDG as a docker image by
```
$ docker pull hallawalla/paralleldg
```

## Usage
See the Jupyter notebooks (and .py's) in examples/.


## Scripts
### Continuous data
To approximate the underlying decomposable graph posterior given the dataset sample_data/data_ar1-5.csv run
```
$ parallelDG_ggm_sample -M 10000 -R 100 -f sample_data/data_ar1-5.csv
```
this will produce a file containing the Markov chain generated by the sample model
In order to analyze the chain run
```
$ analyze_graph_tajectories
```
this will produce a bunch of files in the current directory to be analyzed.

### Discrete data
The data set examples/data/czech_autoworkers.csv contains six binary variables.
To generate a MCMC trajectories of decomposable graphs type
```
$ parallelDG_loglinear_sample -M 10000 -R 100 -f sample_data/czech_autoworkers.csv
```
and
```
$ analyze_graph_tajectories
```
this will produce a number of files in the current directory.
